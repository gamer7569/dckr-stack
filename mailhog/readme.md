# MailHog

MailHog is an email testing tool for developers:

- Configure your application to use MailHog for SMTP delivery (mailhog:1025)
- View messages in the web UI (http://docker:8025/), or retrieve them with the JSON API
- Optionally release messages to real SMTP servers for delivery
- Use [Jim](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/blob/master/docs/JIM.md) to create chaos and randomly simulate errors.
